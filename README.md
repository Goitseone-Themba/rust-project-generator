### Rust CLI application that generates a new rust project...
I'm new to rust so what better way to learn than making CLI apps right? >_<

## How to build
clone the project and cd into rust-project-generator.
run `cargo build` to generate a rust-generator binary in the .target/debug/

## Usage
run `./rust-generator <name>` , and it'll generate a simple rust project.

/name
  |__/src
  |   |__main.rs
  |__Cargo.toml
  |__README.md
